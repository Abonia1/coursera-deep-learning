A series of online courses offered by [deeplearning.ai](https://www.deeplearning.ai/). I would like to say thanks to Prof. [**Andrew Ng**](www.andrewng.org) and his colleagues for spreading knowledge to normal people and great courses sincerely.  


### Reminder
-------------------
the reason I would like to create this repository is purely for academic use (in case for my future use). I am really glad if you can use it as a reference and happy to discuss with you about issues related with the course even further deep learning techniques. 

**Please only use it as a reference**. The quiz and assignments are relatively easy to answer, hope you can have fun with the courses.  

Courses come under Deep Learning Specialization with deeplearning.ai

### 1. Neural Network and Deep Learning

### 2. Improving Deep Neural Networks-Hyperparameter tuning, Regularization and Optimization

### 3. Structuring Machine Learning Projects

### 4. Convolutional Neural Network

### 5. Sequence Models
